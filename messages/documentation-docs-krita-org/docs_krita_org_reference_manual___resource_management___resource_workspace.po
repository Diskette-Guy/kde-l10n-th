msgid "Workspaces are basically saved configurations of dockers.  Each workspace saves how the dockers are grouped and where they are placed on the screen.  They allow you to easily move between workflows without having to manual reconfigure your setup each time.  They can be as simple or as complex as you want."

You can also import them (from a ``\\*.kws`` file), or delete them (which :ref:`deactivates <deactivating_resources>` them)."

This is useful when the secondary workspace is a very sparse workspace with few dockers, and the primary is one with a lot of different dockers."
