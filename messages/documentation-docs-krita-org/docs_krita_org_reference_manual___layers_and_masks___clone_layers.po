In the context menu, there is an action named :guilabel:`Set Copy From`. Click it. A dialog will pop up and there is a drop-down menu with all possible layers to be set as the source of all selected Clone Layers. If the current source of them consists of multiple layers, the default activated selection in the drop-down menu will be blank. Otherwise, it would be the common source of selected Clone Layers."
