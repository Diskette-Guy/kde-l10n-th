msgid "If build with :program:`libtiff 4.2` or later, :program:`Krita` can open and save :program:`Photoshop` style layered ``.tiff``. These are different from regular layered ``.tiff``, as :program:`Photoshop` stores :ref:`file_psd` data inside the ``.tiff``. This means things like layerstyles and blending modes can be stored and read by :program:`Photoshop`, but not every software that can open layered ``.tiff`` will be able to open these."
