msgid "Accuracy indicates how many samples, and thus how often the algorithm is run. A low accuracy will do few samples, but will also run the algorithm fewer times, making it faster. Higher accuracy will do many samples, making the algorithm run more often and give more precise results, but because it has to do more work, it is slower."

This will be best explained with some testing, but if the surrounding image has mostly small elements, like branches, a small patch size will give better results, while a big patch size will be better for images with big elements, so they get reused as a whole."
