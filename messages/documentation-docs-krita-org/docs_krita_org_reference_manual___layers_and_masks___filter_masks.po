msgid "Filter masks show an area of their layer with a filter (such as blur, levels, brightness / contrast etc.). For example, if you select an area of a paint layer and add a Filter Mask, you will be asked to choose a filter. If you choose the blur filter, you will see the area you selected blurred."

msgid "You can edit the settings for a filter mask at any time by double clicking on it in the Layers docker. You can also change the selection that the filter mask affects by selecting the filter mask in the Layers docker and then using the paint tools in the main window. Painting white includes the area, painting black excludes it, and all other colors are turned into a shade of gray which applies proportionally."
