msgid "Floating point bit-depths are used by the computer graphics industry to record scene referred values, which can be made via a camera or a computer renderer. Scene referred values means that the file can have values whiter than white, which in turn means that such a file can record lighting conditions, such as sunsets very accurately. These EXR files can then be used inside a renderer to create realistic lighting."
