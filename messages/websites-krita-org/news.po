The Android and ChromeOS versions of Krita both use the Android platform, and that platform changes often and arbitrarily. This means that Sharaf has spent almost all of his time keeping Krita running on Android (and ChromeOS), instead of, as we had planned, work on a dedicated tablet user interface for Krita on Android. And since that maintenance work now is not being done, we're having a really big problem there. Additionally, since KDE has retired the binary factory and moved binary builds to invent.kde.org's continuous integration system, we don't have automatic builds for Android anymore."

On Windows, OpenGL drivers are pretty buggy, and because of that, Qt5 offered the possibility to use the Angle compatibility layer between applications that use OpenGL and the native Direct3D library for GPU rendering. That's gone, and unless we rewrite our GPU rendering system, we need to put Angle back into the stack."

In order to figure out whether that's true, we started investigating one particular project: AI-assisted inking of sketches. This is useful, could replace a tedious step when doing art while still retaining the artistic individuality. Whether it will actually make it to Krita is uncertain of course, but the investigation will hopefully help us understand better the issue, the possibilities and the problems."

We needed something that would work just as well if not better, but small enough that it can be added to Krita without making it twice as big. (In theory, we could do like some other companies and make the processing happen on some kind of a server, but that wasn’t what we wanted. And even if it resolved some of our issues, it would provide plenty of its own major challenges. Also, we wanted for our users to be able to use it locally without a reliance on our servers and the internet).

Generally, as I understand it, a conventionally good quality single-pixel line for to pixel artists is one that has minimal right-angle changes of direction (L-shapes, T-shapes, and so on).

The first was a digital image manipulation application, the other was a toolkit to create user-friendly applications in C++. But GIMP didn't use Qt, it used its home-grown user interface toolkit (although it originally used Motif, which wasn't open source). A Qt fan, Matthias Ettrich, did an experimental port of GIMP to Qt, and gave a presentation about it at the [1998 Linux Kongress](http://www.linux-kongress.org/1998/abstracts.html).

A lot happened in that year; Camilla Boemann rewrote the core of Krita so we had autosizing layers, Adrian Page wrote an OpenGL based backend, Cyrille Berger added the first inklings of plugins and scripting. Our approach was still pretty technical, though, and we didn't manage to make a release."

Without second thought, I agreed, and knew that Krita would be the focal point of the book. Thus, in 2022, ‘Draw and Paint Better with Krita’ was published worldwide, and has become a sort of “guardian angel” guide for artists around the world, which I’m super humbled by and grateful for."

The first model removes unnecessary lines and smoothes the lines out, and the second model creates nice, crisp lines. The only problem with using them one after another is that SketchyModel produces pretty dark lines, while InkModel is sensitive to values and requires the input to be light grey, otherwise it doesn’t work properly, hence the additional white layer."
