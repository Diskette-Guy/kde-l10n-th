Before we had a fragile system of models, where we should have been using a proper database, and thus, we are now using an SQLite database as the core of our resource handling. This fixes many bugs with tagging and loading resources as well as a handful of UI problems. It also makes our resource system faster and leaner. Because we are now not loading all resources at once, Krita will now start up quicker, and take up less working memory (from our tests, Krita 5.0 took up 200 mb less RAM!)."

However, if you used subtle gradients, you would sometimes see banding, caused by there being too few colors available in 8 bit images for a smooth gradient. We have [implemented dithering for gradients](https://docs.krita.org/en/reference_manual/tools/gradient_draw.html) in 8 bit images, which involves using a blue noise pattern to create a little bit of offset in the boundary between colors. This way, even 8 bit images which don't always have enough colors to trick the human eye that something is smooth, can have the illusion of smoothness in these gradients."

Previously, Krita required users to point to an FFmpeg executable somewhere on their system in order to use many of the features pertaining to video, such as animation video export, video import as animation, and the Recorder Docker for recording your painting sessions. This was mostly good enough for studio use, but it was still difficult to set up for users who aren't that technical, and almost impossible to do on locked down systems like Android or even a school computer. To make this better for almost everyone, we spent some time to include a basic build of FFmpeg into Krita itself, which should include \"out-of-the-box\" support for every free and open container and codec format under the sun. (Along with **Emmet** and **Eoin**, big thanks to **Amyspark**, **Ivan, Sharaf** and **Dmitry** who put in a lot of effort to help get every possible format building and working across various platforms.)
