msgid "The origin of Krita can be traced to Matthias Ettrich's at the [1998 Linux Kongress](http://www.linux-kongress.org/1998/abstracts.html). Matthias wanted to show the ease with which it was possible to hack a Qt GUI around an existing application, and the application he chose to demo it with was [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org). His patch was never published, but did cause problems with the GIMP community at the time."

The basic idea back then was to make KImageShop a GUI shell around [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/ \"ImageMagick\"). It was going to be a corba-based application with out-of-process filter plugins, compatible with GIMP plugins, which are also out-of-process, though of course not corba-based."

At the end of 2020, I learned that Krita would display a bigger version of the splash on Hi-DPI screens. The previous splash lacked the detail under such high resolution. Upon this point I had been using a minimalist approach to focus on the basics. But to privide a nice-looking Hi-DPI splash, I had to introduce more sophisticated techniques back to my works. The new approach allowed me to explore designs that wasn't possible before. To live up to Kiki's \"Cyber Squirrel\" name sake, I gave Kiki a more convincing robotic body with lots of exposed mechanical frames and joints. Translucent parts were applied to her hair, ears and tail. Her costume is the marriage of traditional maid attire and futuristic flashy materials."

The whole picture was done using only Krita's default basic-5 size brush. A side note: I was born as a left hand user (just like Kiki), but was forced to use my right hand since I was 6. 30 years later in 2020, I decided to go back to use my left hand.

The chibi proportion was an attempt to make her look more \"mascot-like\". Her color scheme was changed to loosely reflect Krita's new icon's Cyan-Magenta-Yellow colors, although yellow was left out to make the visual elements look more organized. Cyan and Magenta were shifted to Sky-Blue and Pink for a more girly impression. This version of Kiki has the most generic anime look of all, and my intention back then was to make this her final design (which from hindsight, did not last for very long)."
