msgid "Communication and collaboration within large groups and spread over several time zones is complex and something of the norm in modern projects and the existing solutions available are not up to that challenge. Kube is a way to simplify and make communication elegant again by focusing on the key needs of users instead of filling it with any feature that comes to mind. Our strict focus on what is actually needed instead of what is wanted brings a new way of collaboration between group members and a simpler way of handling communication."
