This allows users to decide what they want from the software they use and, in turn, make decisions about the hardware they use as well. Users are able to reduce the energy consumption of their programs with little or no loss in functionality, installing only what they need, no more and no less; they can also avoid invasive advertising or data-mining options which run processes in the background, further consuming resources on the device and in the network. As for FOSS developers, they typically continue to support hardware that the industry would be eager to make obsolete, providing users with up-to-date and secure software for devices that might otherwise be discarded as e-waste and end up polluting landfills."
