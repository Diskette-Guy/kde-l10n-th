One point, for instance, came up when discussing the transparency criteria of the Blauer Engel ([Section 3.1.3.2](https://produktinfo.blauer-engel.de/uploads/criteriafile/en/DE-UZ%20215-202001-en-Criteria-2020-02-13.pdf)). Malte Reißig from the IASS Research Group on \"[Digitalisation and Sustainability Transformations](https://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/research-group/digitalisation-sustainability)\" highlighted how open development may positively affect some of the other requirements of the award criteria (see [this discussion](https://invent.kde.org/teams/eco/blue-angel-application/-/issues/57)), such as the long-term maintainability and user autonomy of a software product. That is, Free Software users do not only passively use software, but they are encouraged and able to express wishes for the future development of applications, and may actively participate in the planning of milestones. Moreover, with open development, commit messages can be linked to specific issues or bugs reported by a community of users and developers. With Free Software, an application is not just an end product, but an open process reflecting the needs and wants of its users and their communities. With FOSS, the community drives the direction of development!"

Another possibility is certifying distribution-specific releases, such as that for the Microsoft Store. In fact, the latter could be used for marketing purposes to reach new users and bring them into the KDE community -- see, e.g., [this discussion](https://invent.kde.org/teams/eco/blue-angel-application/-/issues/56)."

msgid "When reviewing the SUS action logs for Okular for the Blauer Engel application, two important points were made that will improve implementation of SUS when measuring in the lab. One was the observation about the need to document not only actions but also the objects of actions (e.g., when using a pdf-reader, which pdf is opened), as this can influence the energy-consumption. The other was that including idle action is important when defining a SUS: idle action is both realistic and can show nothing is happening when nothing is *supposed* to be happening."

msgid "Several other issues were brought to the virtual table. Nicolas Fella, a software engineer at KDAB Berlin, expressed interest in comparing two chat clients, which shifted the conversation to defining single scenarios when comparing two applications with similar usage. A single SUS will limit which software functions can be tested, but it will make results from the measurements directly comparable. Moreover, for client-server software such as a chat or email clients, there is the issue of the network component, which for controlled testing would require setting up and measuring the energy consumption of a server. Former KDE e.V. president and long-time KDE contributor [Cornelius Schumacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Schumacher) pointed out that for the [KMail measurements](https://invent.kde.org/teams/eco/blue-angel-application/-/tree/master/applications/kmail) only the computing work on the local machine was measured. Measuring non-local computing in client-server software is more relevant than ever in today's world, and this is currently planned for the revised Blauer Engel award criteria for software."

An important point was that different emulation tools do different things, which could present challenges to automating the process. For instance, one cannot type text when using *KXmlGui* for emulation, and thus something like *xdotool* may still be needed. On a related note, another proposal was to structure an SUS in such a way that creation of an action log can also be automated. Would anyone in the community like to help tackle these challenges?"

msgid "Standard Usage Scenarios are run on a reference system, and an important issue raised was how to have a replicable reference system. There are several system layers to consider: Hardware (CPU, Disk, Ram, etc.); the OS and OS services such as the activity manager in Plasma as well as their configurations; and the tested application's configuration as well as any related applications (e.g., Akonadi for PIM applications). On the one hand, it is necessary to have a controlled environment in order to be able to interpret the results; on the other hand, it is desirable to have measurements which reflect actual, perhaps even noisy computing environments in order to understand the real-world energy consumption of software. In the end, whether to have controlled or natural computing environments will depend on what the data is to be used for, and this will differ for researchers, developers, eco-label auditors, companies, etc."

For instance, this issue arose recently when preparing a Standard Usage Scenario for [GCompris](https://apps.kde.org/gcompris/). I came up with a solution of resizing the screen to a minimum screen resolution and including the code at the beginning of the Actiona script. Whenever the script runs in a different system, it automatically resizes to the minimum resolution to match the pixels while making the script. This is just an idea and is not yet tested. I will put aside time for this attempt to fix the problem with the help of the GCompris team."

msgid "The Blue Angel is awarded to a range of products and services, from paper products to construction materials to printers. In 2020 the German Environment Agency extended the award criteria to include software products, which was the first in the world of environmental certifications to link transparency and user autonomy with sustainability. In order to obtain the ecolabel, a software product must demonstrate that it meets a list of stringent requirements considered critical for the environment over the product's life cycle. These include providing transparency in the energy consumption when using the software -- for example, in the case of Okular, while reading or annotating a PDF -- and the ability to run the application on hardware at least five years old. The Blue Angel award criteria also include a list of user autonomy requirements which reduce the environmental impact of software."

msgid "All of these criteria reflect KDE's values and those of the larger FOSS movement seamlessly. With Free and Open-Source Software, transparency is guaranteed and control is handed over to the users, instead of being held back by vendors or service providers. This allows users to decide what they want from the software they use and, all too often overlooked, the hardware as well. For instance, users may drive down the energy consumption of their programs with no loss in functionality as they can install only what they need, no more and no less; and avoid advertising and data-mining options, which would run unnecessary processes in the background driving up the consumption of resources. As for FOSS developers, they typically continue to support hardware that the industry would be eager to obsolete, providing users with up-to-date and secure software for devices that might otherwise be discarded as e-waste and end up polluting landfills. In short, as a consequence of the user freedoms and transparency guaranteed by a Free Software license, users and communities are able to influence the factors determining the resource consumption of their software!"

Although the problem of software-driven e-waste is relevant for an increasing number of digital devices, the focus will be on desktop PCs, laptops, and, when possible, smartphones and tablets. We are planning to set up info-stands at fair-trade, organic, and artisanal markets as well as sustainability festivals such as the [Umweltfestival](https://www.umweltfestival.de/) in Berlin. We will distribute [leaflets](https://invent.kde.org/teams/eco/opt-green/-/blob/master/materials/leaflets/EN/kde-eco-umweltfestival-flyer-EN_final.jpg) to consumers, and demo vendor-abandoned devices which are not only usable, but also a joy to use thanks to the tireless work of inspiring Free Software communities. Installation workshops will give users the know-how to keep their devices in use for as long as they want."

KEcoLab makes the process even easier by enabling developers to remotely measure the energy consumption of their software using GitLab's CI/CD pipeline. What's more, at the end of the measurement process you will have an energy consumption report ready for Blue Angel eco certification."
