msgid "Using the UR22mkII in Kdenlive using the stock audio settings was impossible, as the automatic fade-in made any voice over editing a complete and utter fail. Curiously, the UR22mkII worked beautifully when playing back audio using an Android tablet (that is a beautiful aspect of the UR22mkII: it is designed to be used with mobile devices). For comparison, a (much bulkier) Behringer QX1202USB does not exhibit the strange behavior even with the default audio settings in Kdenlive, or when using PulseAudio."
