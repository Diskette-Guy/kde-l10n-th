msgid "Kdenlive is first and foremost a video editor, not a :abbr:`SFX(Special Effects)` or :abbr:`VFX(Visual Effects)` tool. Nevertheless, it comes with a comprehensive set of :doc:`effects and filters </effects_and_filters>`, :doc:`compositions and transitions </compositing>`, and :doc:`masking tools </compositing/masking_and_tracking>`. For adding texts, titles, graphics and animation, while more a task of the FX department, Kdenlive has its built-in :doc:`Title App</titles_and_graphics/titles/titles>`, and integrates with |glaxnimate| for :doc:`/titles_and_graphics/graphics_and_animations/animations`"
